		<h3>PREAMBLE</h3>

		<p>The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The clauses that<br/> are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we<br/>act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic<br/>and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the<br/>aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.</p>

		<p>Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design,<br/>development, testing, and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In<br/>accordance with their commitment to the health, safety, and welfare of the public, software engineers<br/>shall adhere to the following eight Principles:</p>

		<h3>PRINCIPLES</h3>

		<ol>
            <li><em>Public.</em> Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.</li>
            <li><em>Client and employer.</em> Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their<br/>client and employer, consistent with the public interest.</li>
            <li><em>Product.</em> Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the<br/>highest professional standards possible.</li>
            <li><em>Judgment.</em> Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional<br/>judgment.</li>
            <li><em>Management.</em> Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an<br/>ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.</li>
            <li><em>Profession.</em> Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession<br/> consistent with the public interest.</li>
            <li><em>Colleagues.</em>Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.</li>
            <li><em>Self.</em> Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their<br/>profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.</li>
        </ol>
